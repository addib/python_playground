#banking_basics

Let's create a project to simulate a banking system.

1. You first need to provide a prompt to the user asking if they wish to create a new savings account or access an existing one.
2. If it is a new savings account that they wish to create, you need to accept their name and initial deposit.
3. And then in your program you need to have a five digit random number generator. This random number will be the account number of their new savings account.
4. If it is an existing account that they wish to access you need to accept their name and account number and check if it's a valid user.
5. Then you need to provide them options to withdraw, deposit or display their available balance if it is a valid user.
